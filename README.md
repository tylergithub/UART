# UART
 FPGA receives data through UART Receiver then display the received data on the 7-segment-display.


UART(Serial Port/RS-232 Interface/COM Port) is one of the simplest FPGA communication methods.

UART Configuration Parameters (Common setting):
	Baud Rate: (115200)  //bits per sec
	Number of Data Bits (8)
	Parity Bit (Off)
	Stop Bits (1)
	Flow Control (None)
